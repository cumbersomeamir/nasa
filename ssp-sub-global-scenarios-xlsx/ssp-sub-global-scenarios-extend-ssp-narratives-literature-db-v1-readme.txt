Sub-global Scenarios that Extend the Global SSP Narratives: Literature Database, v1 (2014-2021)


PURPOSE

To provide a literature database tracking the use of the sub-global scenarios consisting of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that extend the global SSP narratives and framework for climate, socioeconomic, environmental, and other related research.


DESCRIPTION

The Sub-global Scenarios that Extend the Global SSP Narratives: Literature Database, Version 1, 2014-2021 consists of 37 columns of bibliographic data, methodological and analytical insights, from 155 papers published from 2014 to 2021 that extended the narratives of global SSPs. Local and regional scale Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) have grown largely in addressing Climate Change Impact, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (CCIAV) assessments at sub-global levels. Common elements of these studies, besides their focus on CCIAV, are the use of both quantitative and qualitative elements of the SSPs. To explore and learn from current literature on novel methods and insights on extending SSPs, the sub-global extended SSPs literature database is constructed in the research for analyses. The database was developed in four stages: searches; screening; data extraction; and coding. The search stage incorporated three approaches: using a search string in three academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, ScienceDirect); a targeted search of a specific relevant database (ICONICS); and a targeted selection in Google Scholar of all papers that cited the publication of the global SSP narratives. In the screening step, criteria were assessed for full-text papers for eligibility including relevant typologies, methodologies, and other criteria. Finally, data from eligible papers was extracted and entered in a coding framework in an Excel workbook spreadsheet. The coding framework resulted in 37 columns to systematize coding of data from the 155 papers selected along several different dimensions, including categories of papers or analysis, several subcategories for SSP Applications and SSP Extensions, specific SSPs used, specific Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) used, typologies of extensions of qualitative and quantitative SSPs, types of models, and the nature of the extended SSPs.
